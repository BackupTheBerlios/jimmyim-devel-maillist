Subject: [Jimmyim-devel] MSNProtocol downgrade
Message-ID: <000001c6bc73$4c7b0770$0200a8c0@HlevZoran60c246b6a2>

I downgraded the MSN protocol version to 10 (Gaim uses the same version),
because of challenge.Challenge algorithm for v.11 is too demanding for
mobile phones, therefore it is better to implement v.9. A great amount of
code for implementation of v.11 is already written (3/4 steps). This code
was uploaded in branches/Zoran/MSNP11challenge.java. 

 

Upload comment to branches/Zoran/MSNP11challenge.java:

>This is a piece of source code that originates from the function
parseChallenge() in file MSNProtocol.java. Due to a downgrade to protocol
version 10, this code is not neccessary anymore. Challenge algorithm for MSN
protocol v.11 is tough and hard to implement on mobile devices. Three steps
out of for are implemented in this code.<

 

Best regards, 

Zoran

I don't think so. We still didn't implemented all the needed features.
I think we should announce the beta release in a few days.

steps to do to beta1:
- fix some bugs with the jabber protocol - it doesn't seem to work
quite well with gristle.org to me
- finish the implementation of ICQ
i think we should do that too:
- change the data structure of the contacts_ attribute in the
protocols to a mapped one for faster access to contacts by userID
