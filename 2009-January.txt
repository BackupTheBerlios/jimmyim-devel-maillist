Hello Jimmy

This is Khaiser from Bangalore (India). I have planed to develop a J2me
application for S60 mobile phones (N-95) that chats with different
IM's(yahoo, ICQ, MSN, AIM). so your open source helped me a lot.But i am
having some issues when i am working with it.


   1. when Trying to login with yahoo ID its giving me some exception...
   2. when chatting with MSN messages from PC are delivered to Mobile client
   but very late (with delay)
   3. If i have to include other IM's say for argument like AIM or gTalk
   what will be the procedure.

Hope to get a response from your end.

Thanks
Khaiser Ahmed j
