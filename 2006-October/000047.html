<PRE>Hello!

This is how I setup JimmyIM in Eclipse:
-after installing Eclipse &amp; eclipseME, I setup the J2ME configuration in
Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;J2ME:
- First Set the WTK root(basically your folder where you installed Wirelles
toolkit)
- go to Device management and Import, then specify the directory(usually the
same as WTK root) and click refresh - in my case, 4 devices were found, that
is all you need. Click finish and then select e.q. DefaultColorPhone.

Create new Project(J2ME projects - J2ME Midlet Suite) and called it JimmyIM.
In the New J2ME Project dialog the Device-Group should be automatically
selected(J2ME Wirelles toolkit 2.2 in my case and DefaultColorPhone for
default device) if you have done first three steps. Do not mess with the
Library tab and other tabs - it should work out of the box.

Then just copy everything to your project folder. The project directory on
your hard drive should look something like this(depends on the platform and
the IDE version):

.settings
jimmy(with files Account.java, ChatSession.java, Jimmy.java,... and
subfolders icq, jabber, media, ...)
verified
.claspath
.eclipseme
.project
JimmyIM.jad

Refresh the project and run it. A Run dialog opens up. Select Wireless
tookit emulator and New_configuration(create one if it does not exists) with
the Executable-&gt;Midlet jimmy.Jimmy (in my case, this were default settings).
Run! The emulator should pop out.

I did not get any warnings or errors. JimmyIM.jar and JimmyIM.jad are build
automatically everytime you run&amp;build project in folder /deployed.

Regards, 
Zoran Mesec

I'm trying two diffrent tracks right now and I'm kinda stuck on both :-)

1) Running it from within Eclipse using the emulator.
2) Exporting to a JAR file and run manually in the emulator.


Problem #1 is still stuck as above on the error &quot;Bad version information&quot;. 
Is there any reference in the source or some desc file that refers to the 
version of Java or the wireless toolkit you used that I might need to 
change to match the versions I'm using?


Problem #2, I'm not really confident with how to create the .jar and .jad 
file properly. I rightclick the project and select Export and then 
Java-&gt;JAR file.

I'm seeing a number of problems.

a) At the end of the export wizard I'm asked to enter &quot;Select the class of 
the application entry point&quot;, but when I click Browse the window is empty 
and even if I manually writes &quot;jimmy&quot; there it complains about that the 
class is not selected for export or has no main method.

b) If I extract the created jar file and looks in the MANIFEST.MF file it 
only contains

Manifest-Version: 1.0

while the MANIFEST.MF file in your jar file contains alot more info. This 
causes the emulator to halt when I try to run my jar file with the 
following error:

com.sun.kvem.midletsuite.InvalidJadException: Reason = 13
The file Manifest is missing the required attribute: MIDlet-Name

So, the question is how do I make Eclipse include the project details in 
the exported manifest file?

c) How do I create the .jad file. I'm currently using your .jad file and 
simply modiles the size attribute to match my jar file.


d) I can see in the source zip file there is a build.xml file that seems 
to hold the attributes I need to put in the manifest file. How do I use 
that xml file to build the .jar/.jad file?


Sorry for all these qustions, but right now I just feel like a big 
question mark and am not sure really where to dig for more info about 
these problems..

Cheers / Mathias
