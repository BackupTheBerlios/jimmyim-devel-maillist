<PRE>Hi guys.
As a master thesis project I will be developing a context aware mobile
service.
Basically it will be a simple chat client (on phone or PDA), that alerts you
if a friend is near you. The application will use an existing WLAN network
that has multiple access points, providing a positioning service in a large
shopping galleria in Sweden.
The chat part is not the most important part, but you will have a list of
friends, and be able to see which of them are in the same galleria. You will
be able to locate them on a map and see them move. You will also be alerted
with a sound if a friend enters the galleria, thus making a spontaneous
meeting possible.
It should also be possible for a third parties to add contacts to a users
list (with his permission of course). For instance, communities like
LinkedIn, openBC and Friendster should be able to add contacts to this
proximity aware application.

So I have been looking into open source projects about J2ME chat clients,
and I think jimmyIM might be a good choice. I would like all major chat
networks to be &quot;proximity enabled&quot;, not just ONE of them. So regardless if
you use MSN or ICQ, you should be able to log on and see who is in the same
area (in this case the galleria only of course).

I have an idea of how I could solve the third party adding of contacts. I'm
still just in system design phase...

So do you guys think this is a good idea? I'm very excited to get this
working!
Especially since when I started out I thought I would have to have my own IM
server... but what users really want is use what they already have and just
have it work in this new client! It would be so cool! :)

I have many devices I can use here, PDAs and phones.
I installed jimmyIM on a sony ericsson M600i, but there seems to be some
problem connection to my icq and MSN accounts. :/
At least with ICQ, I was that it actually logged in, because I was logged
out on my laptop when I logged in with the phone. But nothing else worked,
it got stuck connecting.

Hope I can count on some help from you guys in this project, it would be
awesome.
Oh btw, I'm doing this master thesis at a company: www.appearnetworks.com,
on their application platform (it runs in the galleria, on using the &quot;cisco
location appliance&quot; as a positioning system).


Cheers,
