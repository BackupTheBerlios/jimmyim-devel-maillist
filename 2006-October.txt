Subject: [Jimmyim-devel] setting up JimmyIM in Eclipse IDE
In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610212134250.16952@mail.nilings.se>
Message-ID: <000301c6f5bf$6636bda0$0200a8c0@HlevZoran60c246b6a2>

Hello!

This is how I setup JimmyIM in Eclipse:
-after installing Eclipse & eclipseME, I setup the J2ME configuration in
Window->Preferences->J2ME:
- First Set the WTK root(basically your folder where you installed Wirelles
toolkit)
- go to Device management and Import, then specify the directory(usually the
same as WTK root) and click refresh - in my case, 4 devices were found, that
is all you need. Click finish and then select e.q. DefaultColorPhone.

Create new Project(J2ME projects - J2ME Midlet Suite) and called it JimmyIM.
In the New J2ME Project dialog the Device-Group should be automatically
selected(J2ME Wirelles toolkit 2.2 in my case and DefaultColorPhone for
default device) if you have done first three steps. Do not mess with the
Library tab and other tabs - it should work out of the box.

Then just copy everything to your project folder. The project directory on
your hard drive should look something like this(depends on the platform and
the IDE version):

.settings
jimmy(with files Account.java, ChatSession.java, Jimmy.java,... and
subfolders icq, jabber, media, ...)
verified
.claspath
.eclipseme
.project
JimmyIM.jad

Refresh the project and run it. A Run dialog opens up. Select Wireless
tookit emulator and New_configuration(create one if it does not exists) with
the Executable->Midlet jimmy.Jimmy (in my case, this were default settings).
Run! The emulator should pop out.

I did not get any warnings or errors. JimmyIM.jar and JimmyIM.jad are build
automatically everytime you run&build project in folder /deployed.

Regards, 
Zoran Mesec

I'm trying two diffrent tracks right now and I'm kinda stuck on both :-)

1) Running it from within Eclipse using the emulator.
2) Exporting to a JAR file and run manually in the emulator.


Problem #1 is still stuck as above on the error "Bad version information". 
Is there any reference in the source or some desc file that refers to the 
version of Java or the wireless toolkit you used that I might need to 
change to match the versions I'm using?


Problem #2, I'm not really confident with how to create the .jar and .jad 
file properly. I rightclick the project and select Export and then 
Java->JAR file.

I'm seeing a number of problems.

a) At the end of the export wizard I'm asked to enter "Select the class of 
the application entry point", but when I click Browse the window is empty 
and even if I manually writes "jimmy" there it complains about that the 
class is not selected for export or has no main method.

b) If I extract the created jar file and looks in the MANIFEST.MF file it 
only contains

Manifest-Version: 1.0

while the MANIFEST.MF file in your jar file contains alot more info. This 
causes the emulator to halt when I try to run my jar file with the 
following error:

com.sun.kvem.midletsuite.InvalidJadException: Reason = 13
The file Manifest is missing the required attribute: MIDlet-Name

So, the question is how do I make Eclipse include the project details in 
the exported manifest file?

c) How do I create the .jad file. I'm currently using your .jad file and 
simply modiles the size attribute to match my jar file.


d) I can see in the source zip file there is a build.xml file that seems 
to hold the attributes I need to put in the manifest file. How do I use 
that xml file to build the .jar/.jad file?


Sorry for all these qustions, but right now I just feel like a big 
question mark and am not sure really where to dig for more info about 
these problems..

Cheers / Mathias

Hello,
Sorry for the lame question, but why Eclipse needs at all ?
I mean that I complied and run emulator  with Sun tools
(SDK and wireless tools kit) and that all, beside my personal problem with
CLDC-1.0, 
When I choosing CLDC-1.1 , everything ok...

An alternative is NetBeans with mobility pack. However, problems with
debuging were present on my computer only. Others using Eclipse were
debuging fine. If I were launching the application with the play button (not
the bug button), it worked though.

Did you try running the jad manually with emulator? (emulator.exe should be
located in your j2me wireless toolkit I think or even in java dir - under
Linux).

YEES!

Thanks alot for talking the time to descibe this! I still got my 44 
warnings following your guide, but that might have todo with diffrences in 
how we have Eclipse configured, what to warn about, or that I'm using a 
diffrent version of Java or the Wireless toolkit.

However, I was now succefully able to launch the app in the emulator 
without any errors about diffrent version.

I think the problem was that when I pulled project from SVN I also got the 
.eclipseme file from SVN which contained bad version information about the 
wireless toolkit. But when I created a new project locally and copied the 
sourcetree I left the .eclipseme file as it was created by Eclipse on my 
machine and then it worked.

Hopefully I will now also be able to export the project to a JAR file and 
run it so I can make some changes and try them in my mobile phone... Time 
to try!

Thanx again!

Cheers // Mathias

Message-ID: <000001c6f621$a0c2ea40$0200a8c0@HlevZoran60c246b6a2>

Here are the results of the JimmyIM conference on
Jabber.org(jimmyim at conference.jabber.org) held on 22.10.2006 around 9pm:

a)TODOs before version 1.0(developers for the tasks are listed after
comments //):
- the debugging of ICQ :) (help yourself with jimm)	//sahel
- debugging of MSN on Sony E. & Nokia devices and fixing the SSL certificate
bug	//stereo_sl
- CLDC 1.0. support - only Splash.java needs to be modified	//slashrsm
and whiteangel
- finishing localization	//all developers 
- GoogleTalk fix(currently not working)	//whiteangel
- do not display offline contacts(seems like a rational decision if you have
100 contacts and only ten are online) or add a setting for showing offline
contact(show offline contacts/do not show offline contacts)	//slashrsm
- improve the design of the website		//stereo_sl

TODOs after v1.0.(only experimental suggestions):
- contact sorting
- fancy UI with the J2ME Polish API(http://www.j2mepolish.org/index.html)
- obviously Yahoo(I have just noticed new documentation here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Messenger_Protocol and here
http://www.venkydude.com/articles/yahoo.htm )


b)MSN bug:
The reason why MSN did not work on many devices is unknown SSL certificate.

c)Sorting contacts:
An idea of Mathias Sundman that suggests a setting to indicate how contacts
are sorted in the list:
- none
- by username
- by screename

After everyone agree with the TODOs list, I will put it on the website so
that users can see what we are doing.

Message-ID: <453DCE1C.6040302@guest.arnes.si>

Greetings to all,

In R425 I added SSL connection support to server handler. I also added
useSSL attribute to Account and its getter/setter methods.

Saving/Loading of the useSSL property is also done, so *please remove
any old jimmy config files* or Jimmy will crash.

Janez, could you add a "Use SSL connection" checkbox to Account settings
widget? Currently, SSL is disabled by default in JimmyUI.

Zoran, I removed the obsolete login(user, pass) method - it's now
superseded by login(account). I cut&paste the code from login(u,p) to
login(account), so please check if everything is ok.

The current implementation should work, I didn't manage to connect to
GoogleTalk yet though - some issues with certificates which I don't
really get it...


Regards.
- Matev?

Subject: [Jimmyim-devel] using jimmyIM in master thesis project,
	developing a context aware mobile service?
Message-ID: <45477227.52051324.7d3d.ffffe8e4@mx.google.com>

Hi guys.
As a master thesis project I will be developing a context aware mobile
service.
Basically it will be a simple chat client (on phone or PDA), that alerts you
if a friend is near you. The application will use an existing WLAN network
that has multiple access points, providing a positioning service in a large
shopping galleria in Sweden.
The chat part is not the most important part, but you will have a list of
friends, and be able to see which of them are in the same galleria. You will
be able to locate them on a map and see them move. You will also be alerted
with a sound if a friend enters the galleria, thus making a spontaneous
meeting possible.
It should also be possible for a third parties to add contacts to a users
list (with his permission of course). For instance, communities like
LinkedIn, openBC and Friendster should be able to add contacts to this
proximity aware application.

So I have been looking into open source projects about J2ME chat clients,
and I think jimmyIM might be a good choice. I would like all major chat
networks to be "proximity enabled", not just ONE of them. So regardless if
you use MSN or ICQ, you should be able to log on and see who is in the same
area (in this case the galleria only of course).

I have an idea of how I could solve the third party adding of contacts. I'm
still just in system design phase...

So do you guys think this is a good idea? I'm very excited to get this
working!
Especially since when I started out I thought I would have to have my own IM
server... but what users really want is use what they already have and just
have it work in this new client! It would be so cool! :)

I have many devices I can use here, PDAs and phones.
I installed jimmyIM on a sony ericsson M600i, but there seems to be some
problem connection to my icq and MSN accounts. :/
At least with ICQ, I was that it actually logged in, because I was logged
out on my laptop when I logged in with the phone. But nothing else worked,
it got stuck connecting.

Hope I can count on some help from you guys in this project, it would be
awesome.
Oh btw, I'm doing this master thesis at a company: www.appearnetworks.com,
on their application platform (it runs in the galleria, on using the "cisco
location appliance" as a positioning system).


Cheers,
Gabriel Klappenbach
