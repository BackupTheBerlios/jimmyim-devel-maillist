Subject: [Jimmyim-devel] Merged usajusaj-jabber with trunk
Message-ID: <698b8f7f0711161111v4b207ea2p6ef0dc3167575a99@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just merged my version with trunk.
Here is svn merge log:
- Merge with usajusaj-jabber
- Implemented Yahoo protocol (Some code and challenge binary data file
borrowed from jYMSG project)
- Jabber optimizations and minor bug fixes
- ServerHandler code optimisations (getReply(...) methods were implemented 3
times allmost identicaly)
- Added contact sorting. Primary sort is by status, secondary by name
- Added Yahoo protocol to new account wizzard
- Optimizations in Utils (too much type casting)
- XmlNode toString() method implemented

Please test it and report any bugs.

Also found out that MSN and ICQ protocols are out of order. Check their code
asap for protocol changes (I excluded my changes to the code from causes. I
tested both protocols on last stable trunk version and it didn't work there
either).

I also have a question regarding account login/logout.
How can I fire account logout procedure from within my protocol?
Reason: I get LOGOFF packet in Yahoo protocol when I login with the same
account from some other client. When this happens I should change the
Display to MainMenu and execute the same code as it would be executed when I
press Logout button on that Account in MainMenu.

Regards,
Matej U?aj

I'll try to rewrite it using our local MD5 library.

Noted. On the other hand, ICQ is really busted, so I've rewritten the
authentication procedure in a more dynamic way. Expect updates soon. I had
to stop testing it yesterday because I was banned from the server for
flooding it :) I hope they've unbanned be allready. Authentication is
completed, only roster parsing is still busted.

I also have a question regarding account login/logout.

Thanks, I'll try it.

To not get blocked from the server, try to login/logout a maximum of 5
minutes between retries. Anyway the normally ban you for about 30min, but if
you keep tring when your banned, than the number increases for every tetry.
:) Yeah, security... :)

Matje, thanks! You've done what i was telling to myself to fix for a year
now :)

regards
Dejan
