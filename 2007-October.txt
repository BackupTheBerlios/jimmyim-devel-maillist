Subject: [Jimmyim-devel] Jabber protocol fix
Message-ID: <698b8f7f0710180033x7b48b237yc25629d23085006@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just merged my branch with trunk.

Updates are:
- Rewritten jabber protocol (jimmy.jabber.*)
- Very tiny xml parser (jimmy.util.XmlNode)
- Fixed timestamps in ChatWindow (jimmy.ui.ChatWindow)

Jabber protocol now supports DIGEST-MD5, X-GOOGLE-TOKEN and PLAIN
authentication, so most of the jabber servers are now supported (including
GTalk).
Functional add, delete and update contact methods.
Automatically accepts buddy requests (There could maybe be a check box for
this).

TODO:
- zlib connection compression (implemented in bombus project)
- some special features for gtalk
- bug check and testing on cuple of more jabber servers

Comments/ideas/requests?

Cheers!

Matej U?aj

Hi all!

Great work. I've tried it and it works, exept gTalk does not work - probably
I used false settings. Username, server? In pidgin I have:
username: zoran.mesec
server: gmail.com

Also some exception occured after some time chatting in jabber:
[DEBUG] Found Contact to start chat with: sahel at gristle.org
[REC]:<stream:error><xml-not-well-formed
xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-streams'/></stream:error></stream:stream>

java.io.IOException: error 0 during TCP write
at com.sun.midp.io.j2me.socket.Protocol.writeBytes(Protocol.java:360)
at com.sun.midp.io.BaseOutputStream.write(ConnectionBaseAdapter.java:830)

People, do me a favor. Put this
line somewhere in JimmyIM and send me the output.
System.out.println(System.getProperty("microedition.encoding"));
Thank you very much and please write also your OS, default charset...

regards,
Zoran Mesec

It seems like there was an error in the connection.

Hi,

Which device and which .jar do you use?

Jimmy is stil in developement stage. It is being ported to some series
of devices and would really appreciate if you could help us port it.

Hi,

Nokia N73 for example, but on 6XXX i think it doesn't work.

Join the jimmyim-devel list.
I'm on GTalk.

Hi Javier!

First of all, thank you for your feedback and effort.
It is great to see that people from Latin America are also gaining
interest in JimmyIM.


After testing, I have recently found out that JimmyIM does not work on Nokia
devices, because this devices handle inputStream somehow differently than
other mobile devices. You can also download Nokia SKDs with Nokia emulators
and you will found out that JimmyIM also freezes on Nokia emulators.

I have also found out how to solve this problem, but I did not yet have time
to commit/merge my code for Nokia problems. I expect to have this done
in the next two weeks.

All bugs concerning operation on specific devices(like Nokia) should be
fixed by first release which is scheduled around new year, but looks like
we will have to branch our releases&build for Nokia devices.

regards,
Zoran Mesec

Hi all!

Since this week has been one of the most exciting weeks in
the JimmyIM lifetime, it deserves to have a special summary. JimmyIM is back
alive and kicking! To gain some more enthusiasm from all of you, here is a
list of past week's changes:

Matej has:
- improved Jabber protocol(fixed bugs in XML parser, added realtime stamps,
fixed sasl auth,...)
- implemented GoogleTalk!

Zoran:
- fixed MSN bug for authentication
- rewritten localization to support utf-8 encoding
- tested Jimmy on Nokia emulators and found out why JimmyIM does not work on
Nokia devices
- refreshed website with new content

The website has improved on:
- short instructions 'how to set up the environment' for new developers,  :
http://jimmyim.berlios.de/wordpress/?page_id=24
- mobile device database: a list of all devices JimmyIM has been tested&used
on(which includes status of operation, KIs,..)
- appearence in IE(who uses IE, anyway :)
- roadmap(under construction):
http://jimmyim.berlios.de/wordpress/index.php?page_id=25

Message-ID: <698b8f7f0710251614p4e359c27nc908b3f6e8b87bd1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I did some research about yahoo protocol. I managed to implement first few
steps of authentication, but then I stumbled upon a serious problem.
The authentication needs a 29kB binary file for generating a response to
servers challenge string.

Could this be acceptable for limited amount of memory the devices have?

Lep pozdrav

Hi!

Some older phone imply a limitation on jar size, therefore it could be a
problem on older devices. But because JimmyIM is is mainly intended for
newer devices, 180kB(currently 150kB) jar file will not be a problem. For
jar size limitation look
http://dictionarymid.sourceforge.net/suppported.html.

Concerning
memory, I think that it should not be a problem also, as long as you
do not keep whole file in the memory at the same time(
usually heap memory size is 2mb).
Nokia emulator shows memory usage, so we can do some tests, if neccessary.

regards,
Zoran
